# TradeBot

Welcome to the trading bot web application! This application allows users to make automated trades in the financial markets using artificial intelligence.

The bot uses a combination of machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques to analyze various market influencing factors, including tweets, news articles, and technical indicator data. It then uses this analysis to make smart market predictions and execute trades on behalf of the user.

With this application, users can take advantage of the power of AI to make informed and profitable trades, without the need for extensive market analysis and manual trade execution.

## Technology Stack


The trading bot web application is built using a modern and powerful technology stack that allows for efficient development and reliable performance.

At the frontend, we have used React and Redux to build a interactive and responsive user interface. We have also used the Fetch API to communicate with the backend server and retrieve data in a seamless and efficient manner. For styling and UI components, we have utilized Bootstrap and React-strap to give the application a professional and polished look.

On the backend, we have implemented a Flask RESTful API server to handle requests from the frontend and communicate with the trading bot. Flask is a lightweight Python web framework that is easy to set up and customize, making it a great choice for this application.

Overall, the combination of React, Redux, and Flask allows us to build a powerful and scalable web application for automated trading with artificial intelligence.
